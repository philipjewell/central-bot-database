| Page Preview | `YahooMailProxy` | cloudflare-verified | cloudflare-radar |

**Purpose:** I couldn't find any information about a specific bot named "YahooMailProxy". However, based on your hint that it is an operator for "Page Preview", I can provide some context.

The Page Preview operator is likely used to generate previews of emails sent via Yahoo Mail. Its purpose is to display a brief summary or excerpt from the email content in search results, helping users quickly decide whether to open the full email message.

**Impact of Blocking:** Blocking the Page Preview operator (YahooMailProxy) could result in reduced visibility for emails sent via Yahoo Mail in search engine results, making it harder for users to find and preview emails without clicking through to the full content. This may lead to a decrease in user engagement with these types of emails, as they become less prominent in search results.
